# rport-ui
This is probably the messiest way of temporarily forwarding ports using rport.

Please dont blame me if this messes something up for you.

## Please note, even though this repository is named 'rport-ui', this script is only has a cli

# If you wish to actually try this.
Steps
1. move config_example.json to config.json
2. Input correct data into config.json
3. Run the program

If desired, you can run the command to temporarily forward just port 22 and open a ssh connection
>`python rport-ui.py <name as it appears in rport>`
